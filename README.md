I have created a demo students api in json format. You can use it in you local server. For running the API in local server, you need to install-
1. Nodejs
2. NPM
Then download or make a custon JSON file with some data and save it. Then go to Command promt where the file was kept, type the command-
"json-server filename.json" and press enter.
The command prompt will give you a local server address, you shouldn't close the command prompt as it will stop the server.
Copy the server link and paste on a new tab of your browser, you shall be able to see the data that you created. Now perform different postman http methods to check whether it is working properly or not.
